|   The July 36 movement in Bangladesh was a mass      |
|   mobilization effort with participation from        |
|   diverse groups, especially:                        |
|                                                      |
|   * University and College Students                  |
|   * Academics and Educators                          |
|   * Youth Activists and Civil Society Members        |
|   * Journalists and Media Personnel                  |
|   * Labor Union Representatives                      |
|   * General Public                                   |
|   * Military Officials (Sympathetic to the Movement) |
|   * Rickshaw Pullers                                 |

|   The July 36 movement of 2024 witnessed             |
|   participation from a broad spectrum of society,    |
|   reflecting its widespread appeal and the depth of  |
|   public discontent. Students were the driving       |
|   force, with university and college campuses        |
|   across Bangladesh acting as epicenters of          |
|   protests. Female students played a particularly    |
|   prominent role, often leading sit-ins and          |
|   breaking through restrictive measures at their     |
|   dormitories. Alongside students, academics, civil  |
|   society members, and professionals, including      |
|   teachers, lawyers, and doctors, joined in          |
|   solidarity, providing intellectual and logistical  |
|   support. Rural and urban workers, small business   |
|   owners, and everyday citizens also mobilized,      |
|   participating in marches, blockades, and the       |
|   pivotal "Long March to Dhaka." This diversity in   |
|   participation emphasized the movement's unified    |
|   demand for justice, democracy, and an end to       |
|   authoritarianism.                                  |
|                                                      |
