|   In 2018, job seekers and general students, led by   |
|   the Bangladesh General Students' Rights Protection  |
|   Council, held continuous protests and human chain   |
|   programs since January 2018 for quota reform. As a  |
|   result of the continuous movement of general        |
|   students, the government announced the abolition of |
|   the 46-year-old quota system in first and second    |
|   class government jobs. On October 4, 2018, the      |
|   Bangladesh government issued a circular abolishing  |
|   the quota system in first and second class          |
|   government jobs.                                    |
|                                                       |
|   The 2024 Quota Reform Movement is a movement        |
|   organized to demand reform of the quota-based       |
|   recruitment system in all types of government jobs  |
|   in Bangladesh. The quota reform movement came into  |
|   renewed discussion after the High Court Division of |
|   the Supreme Court of Bangladesh declared the        |
|   circular issued by the Bangladesh government on     |
|   4 October 2018 to be invalid on 5 June 2024. The    |
|   circular was issued in the context of the 2018      |
|   Quota Reform Movement. Through the circular, all    |
|   existing quotas for recruitment to the ninth grade  |
|   (formerly first grade) and 10th-13th grades         |
|   (formerly second grade) in government jobs were     |
|   abolished.                                          |
|                                                       |
|   Although the movement initially remained confined   |
|   to meetings, on 14 July, Prime Minister Sheikh      |
|   Hasina indirectly referred to the quota protesters  |
|   as "grandchildren of the rajakars" in a speech. In  |
|   response to the Prime Minister's remarks, the       |
|   protesting students sarcastically chanted "Who are  |
|   you? Who am I? Razakar, Razakar; who said it? Who   |
|   said it? Despotism, despotism" and "I wanted        |
|   rights; I became Razakars."                         |
|                                                       |
|   On 15 July, various Awami League and government     |
|   officials and ministers accused the protesting      |
|   students of destroying the 'spirit of the liberation|
|   war.' On the same day, students and protesters were |
|   attacked with rods, sticks, hockey sticks, ramdas,  |
|   and firearms in various places in the country under |
|   the leadership of the ruling party Awami League's   |
|   student wing, Chhatra League. At the same time, the |
|   police also attacked them with sticks and rubber    |
|   bullets. In protest, the protesters also threw      |
|   bricks at them, and clashes broke out between the   |
|   two sides.                                          |
|                                                       |
|   These attacks intensified the protests from         |
|   16 July onwards. When Abu Sayeed was shot dead by   |
|   the police at Begum Rokeya University on 16 July,   |
|   the protests spread like sparks to the far corners  |
|   of the country. By 19 July, when the Chhatra League |
|   and other Awami League organizations, the Border    |
|   Guard Bangladesh (BGB), Rapid Action Battalion      |
|   (RAB), the police, and the internet shutdown failed |
|   to stop the movement, the government imposed a      |
|   nationwide curfew and deployed the army.            |
|                                                       |
|   In these incidents, several thousand students       |
|   (about 21,000 students) and protesters were         |
|   injured, and more than 673 people were killed. The  |
|   police filed 500 cases and arrested more than       |
|   11,000 people. On 21 July, the Bangladesh Supreme   |
|   Court overturned the High Court's ruling and        |
|   ordered that 93 percent of government jobs be       |
|   filled on the basis of merit. On 22 July, the       |
|   government issued a notification in this regard.    |
|                                                       |
